# Hi there, I'm Le Dat 👋 🏀

I build at the intersection of AI and Web3 – creating decentralized applications that are not only scalable, but also intelligent and user-friendly.

With over 2 years of experience in Frontend & Fullstack development, I’ve worked on projects ranging from large-scale banking applications to cutting-edge blockchain platforms. My expertise spans React, Next.js, Solidity, LangChain.js, NestJS, and PostgreSQL, with a strong focus on delivering seamless user experiences.

I thrive in fast-moving environments, collaborating with international teams to turn complex ideas into real, impactful products. Always exploring AI x Blockchain, I’m open to connecting with builders, innovators, marketing and investors who share the same vision for the future of decentralized technology.

Let’s connect and build the next big thing together 🚀
